# EnvironmentalCrisisGame
The year is 2050. Due to human activities, severe changes in the earth's envrironment has occured since the start of the industrial revolution. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have reached 500 ppm, as a result temperatures around the earth started increasing. Pollution now ravages population dense areas, and because of many factors such as population growth and resource mismanagement, fresh water has become scarce. Meanwhile rising ocean levels have hit major population centers. For a century, we have ignored the problem of climate change and pollution, many parts of the industrialized world simply didn't care enough to act. But we can't run away any further. Hundreds of millions of people are displaced due to flooding and desertification, and the scarcity of water has pushed some countries to war. A crisis is emerging, but humanity still has a chance. Seeing the growing threat to their countries, all members of the United Nations have pooled together their efforts and created the Emergency Climate Change commitee, with YOU as it's leader. Until the threat subsides or humanity is finished, you will control the fate of humanity. Are you ready?
